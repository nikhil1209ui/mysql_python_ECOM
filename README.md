In this repository, I added a sql+python portfolio project based on Ecommerce dataset which I got from Kaggle.
First, I dumped my tables which were in .csv format of datasets in mysql database through jupyter notebook using pymysql connector
Then, after establishing the connection and dumping the data, I started writing sql queries in jupyter only and took valuable insights from the data using visulization libraries
